### Overview

A workshop designed to get more familiarity with state machines, look up tables, and recursive loops.

To start, begin in `trainlines.js` and follow the scaffolded comment instructions.


### Objective

By the end, you will have a piece of command line software that allows the user to look at their map, transfer lines, and exit the program via "relaxing".

### Topics

> - Object oriented programming
> - State machines
> - Lookup tables
> - Recursive loops

### Context

#### What is a class constructor?

All a class constructor is, is a template for similar objects to be based off of. For example, in this workshop, all train lines have the same traits, therefore they are of the same class. This allows us to be more efficient in our code.

#### What is a recursive loop?

A recursive loop is a function that calls itself until an exit condition is met. For example, in this workshop, the `riding` function is recursive until the player selects the `relax` action which exits the process.
